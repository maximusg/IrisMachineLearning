Beginning step to utilziation of machine learning by way of implementation of a decision tree classifier. Simple analysis of the iris.csv as the training data,to try and guess to highest level of accuracy the iris2.csv data set.

Training set is used to set the parameters in the "iris_classifer.py" file, and can guessed to a 98% accurarcy. Using the same parameters on the "Geiszler_iris_classiver.py" the second data set "iris2.csv" is guessed to a 92.6% accuracy.


Pandas libary dependency: Must install pandas python library. "pip install pandas"
